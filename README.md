# Helping Out
If you wish to help out, the flow is as follows:

1. Create a branch for the new ticket. make sure it begins with the issue/ticket number.make sure it is branched off `master`
2. Make changes locally. Be sure to create smaller changes with a discrete idea, so each commit reflects an item in a detailed changelog.
3. Commit often (see rule 2). commit messages should ALWAYS begin with a pound and the ticket/issue number on which you are working. If you find you need to fix another issue first, and it is a small enough change, you can just make the change on your current branch. Be sure your commits are discrete, like idea landmarks, such as: `#123 - added js lib to project` or `#826 - update readme to reflect new ideologies`
4. Create a PR in Github for your branch. be sure to push to Github often. If you wish, you can create a PR early, and make sure the title begins with WIP ("work in progress") so we know not to merge it. Expect comments on _any_ PR you have, whether it is finished or not. If you want a preliminary review, you can say so in the PR message.
5. Wait for reviews to come in. If everythign is OK, it will be merged. Make sure you have tests for your code. PRs may not be merged if they don't have tests.
